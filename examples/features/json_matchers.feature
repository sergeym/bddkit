Feature: reading and matching JSON

  Scenario: matchers instead of literal values
    When I request "/users/1" using HTTP GET
    Then the response code is 200
    And the response body contains JSON:
      """
      {
        "id": "@variableType(int)",
        "name": "@variableType(string)",
        "email": "@regExp(/^[^@]+@example\\.com$/)",
        "address": {"geo": {"lat": "@variableType(string)"}},
        "tags": "@arrayLength(3)"
      }
      """

  Scenario: contains is a subset match, extras are allowed
    When I request "/users/1" using HTTP GET
    Then the response code is 200
    # Only the nested key is named here; every other field of the response
    # is ignored. `equals JSON` would fail on exactly this docstring.
    And the response body contains JSON:
      """
      {"address": {"city": "Gwenborough"}}
      """

  Scenario: paths into an array of objects
    When I request "/posts/1/comments" using HTTP GET
    Then the response code is 200
    And the response body is a JSON array of length 2
    And the JSON node "[1].email" should exist
    And extract "[0].email" from JSON as "firstCommenter"
    And variable "firstCommenter" should be equal to "eliseo@example.com"
    # The same path syntax prints one node instead of the whole body.
    And Print response body as "[0].email"

  Scenario: an array matched element by element
    Given the query parameter "userId" is "1"
    When I request "/posts" using HTTP GET
    Then the response code is 200
    # Array containment is order-independent: this element may sit anywhere.
    And the response body contains JSON:
      """
      [{"id": 3, "title": "ea molestias quasi exercitationem"}]
      """
